  "readme": "# volos-oauth-apigee\n\nThis is an OAuth 2.0 implementation for the Volos family of modules that uses Apigee as its source\nof data. That is, information about valid application IDs and secrets, and the access tokens themselves,\nare stored in Apigee.\n\nWhen run locally, this module makes API calls to Apigee to access this information. That makes this\nthe right OAuth module to use when building OAuth-enabled applications to run on the Apigee product,\nbecause when the application is deployed to Apigee itself, it will use all the same data as any other\nApigee application.\n\nIn addition, when deployed to Apigee Edge, this module uses the built-in OAuth implementation without\nany additional API calls. The selection of \"local\" versus \"remote\" operation is made\non the first call to this module.\n\nThis module actually exports the same programming interface as \"volos-oauth-common.\" See that module\nfor detailed documentation.\n\n## Installing the Adapter\n\nThis module depends on an \"adapter,\" which is a special API that is deployed to Apigee for your specific\norganization in the Apigee cloud. This proxy is hosted in the Volos GitHub repo, which is here:\n\n[https://github.com/apigee/volos](https://github.com/apigee/volos)\n\nThe proxy is inside the \"proxy\" directory. Instructions for deploying it may be found here:\n\n[https://github.com/apigee/volos/blob/master/samples/basic/README.md](https://github.com/apigee/volos/blob/master/samples/basic/README.md)\n\n### oauth.create(options)\n\nThe module exports one function, called \"create\".\n\nThe result of this call will be an \"OAuth\" object, which may be used according to the interface defined\nby the \"volos-oauth-common\" module.\n\nThe \"create\" function takes an argument called \"options\" with the following parameters:\n\n* uri: (required) The full URI of the Apigee adapter that you deployed in the last step. For instance, if the organization\nname is \"foo\" then this might be \"https://foo-test.apigee.net/apigee-remote-proxy\".\n* key: (required) An API consumer key for a valid \"application\" that is part of the same organization where the adapter\nwas installed.\n\nThe following parameters are optional:\n\n* apigeeMode (optional): By default, this module will use the OAuth service built in to Apigee Edge when it\nis deployed there, and use an HTTP-based API to the \"uri\" specified above when it is not. This parameter\noverrides that default.\n\n\"apigeeMode\" supports two values:\n\n* remote: When set to \"remote,\" this module will use the \"uri\" specified in the options to communicate\nwith Apigee Edge, even if it is deployed to Apigee Edge. This allows you to use the OAuth services of\nanother organization, for instance.\n* local: When set to \"local,\" this module wil use the \"apigee-access\" module to access Apigee Edge\nfunctionality that is built in to the runtime. If this is set and the module is running outside\nApigee Edge, then all calls will fail.\n\nBy default, the module will use Apigee Edge functionality when available, and fall back to API\ncalls when it is not.\n\n## Deploying to Apigee\n\nThe \"apigeetool\" that you installed while setting up the adapter may also be used to deploy the application to\nApigee. For instance, the following command deploys the script named \"oauthtest.js\" to the organization named\n\"foo\" in the \"test\" environment:\n\n    apigeetool deploynodeapp -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -o foo -e test -n argo-oauth -b /BASEPATH -m oauthtest.js -d .\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nThis module uses the \"debug\" module used by many other Node.js modules. Set the environment\nvariable \"DEBUG\" to \"apigee\" to see information about what is being done.\n",
